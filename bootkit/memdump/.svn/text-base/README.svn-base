Notes:
To memdump from QEMU, type (128mb ram):
memsave 0xc0800000 134217728 mem.dump
hexdump -e '"%07.7_ax  " 1/4 "%08x " "\n"' mem.dump | grep -e "  c[0-7].....[048c]" > memdump.temp
cat memdump.temp | ./memdump/process_dump.pl

Terms:
Access magnitude- The degree of ingress pointers to a particular target address.This may be an indication of the start of an important data structure or memory pool.

In particular, page-aligned addresses with high access magnitudes may be further evidence of the beginning of an object pool.


HOW-TO use the make_dot.sh:
 ./make_dot.sh my_graph pointer.txt > pointer.dot
 cat pointer.dot | dot -Tpng > pointer.png

-must have the "graphviz" program
