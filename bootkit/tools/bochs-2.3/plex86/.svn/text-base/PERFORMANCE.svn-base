PERFORMANCE
===========

Optimize functions in util-nexus.c: mon_memzero, mon_memcpy, mon_memset
  They could be done a lot more efficiently.
  Perhaps make mon_memzero function specifically for pages.

Pseudo devices and special guest-OS specific device drivers for
  disk/network/video/etc and an associated architecture.  This would
  let us pass data more quickly and prevent a lot of emulation overhead.
  The real device emulation could plug into the same architecture as
  the pseudo devices.


Fix extra CR3 reload in nexus.S
