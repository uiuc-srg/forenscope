grub (0.97-16) unstable; urgency=low

  grub-install and update-grub has changed location.
  
  There's a wrapper available in /sbin to keep backward compatibility but
  it'll be removed once Etch is release as stable. You _must_ edit your
  /etc/kernel-img.conf and change the paths to /usr/sbin/update-grub. 
  For example:

  ,----[ /etc/kernel-img.conf ]
  | ...
  | postinst_hook = /sbin/update-grub
  | postrm_hook   = /sbin/update-grub
  `----

  Should be change to:
  
  ,----[ /etc/kernel-img.conf ]
  | ...
  | postinst_hook = /usr/sbin/update-grub
  | postrm_hook   = /usr/sbin/update-grub
  `----
