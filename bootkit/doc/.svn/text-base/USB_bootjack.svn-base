Using grub as a boot loader

Although syslinux is small, simple to install, and comes with a very simple command line menu to select from different boot options, I definitely prefer grub. It is larger, but a lot more flexible and offers a complete boot menu and interactive command interface. With recent versions of grub (tested with 0.97), booting from USB is also possible without real issues. To install grub as a boot loader on the USB stick:
Mount the VFAT(32) file system with mount /dev/sdu1 /mnt (or via KDE, in which case it will probably be mounted under /media/usb, then replace the /mnt occurances below accordingly)
Create a directoriy for grub with mkdir -p /mnt/boot/grub
Copy the grub files with cp /lib/grub/i386-pc/* /mnt/boot/grub
Set a correct device map with echo '(hd0)  /dev/sdu' > /mnt/boot/grub/device.map
Install grub into the master boot record with grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sdu
After that, grub should already be bootable from the USB stick, and booting a PC with the stick attached should show the grub boot menu.
