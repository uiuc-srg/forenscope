+ Added 'I' switch to ava


1.23
----

+ 2.6 port
+ added visible-start

1.12
----

+ fixed adore_atoi() respect to /proc misbehaivior
  a PID of 672 has the string "672üA" so make atoi()
  handle this

  correctly


1.11
----

+ rewrote most parts (using VFS etc)
  -> adore-ng

0.53
----

+ #define PID_MAX if not found


0.52
----
+ support 16 and 32 bit UID/GID
+ using spin-locks
+ hooking lookup in proc_root, so many adore-testers
  fail now
+ much better tcp-connection hiding, also via proc
+ removed file redirection
+ added elite_gid, so its now impossible to detect adore by
  chown()+getdents() bruteforce
+ elite_uid/elite_gid are randomly choosen by "configure"
+ close() should return EBADF when
  user is not authenticated. It does so now.

0.42
----

+ Added devpts fix.

0.41
----

+ fixed is_secret64() to properly hide files.
+ removed memleak

0.40
----

  whether open/stat redir works properly.

0.38
----

+ Nothing. CVS-internally thing.
 

0.36
----

+ Added rename.c as generic way to rename/rmmod protection
  modules such as StMichael.
+ Fixed libinvisble: Dont follow links on chown() ->
  now properly hides symlinks

----

+ Added 64 bit FS support, for 2.4 plus new glibc


0.33
----

+ Added auth via mkdir(2) to defeat scanners
+ setuid() -> close() change since 2.4 kernel uses setuid32()


0.32
----

+ added kgcc check in configure
+ added exec-redirection
+ made 'R' switch stable (now official feature)


0.31
----
+ empty module-list doesn't crash anymore :)
+ removed syslog dis/enabling coz a lot of ppl told me its not of much use
  and it only costs porting time and robustness
+ added removing of procs
+ no chkroot defat anymore. there are too many ways to detect rootkits


...
sowhere below

+ Added 'cant be killed from normal processes'
