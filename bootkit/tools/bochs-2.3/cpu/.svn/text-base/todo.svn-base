TODO (know issues in CPU model):
-------------------------------

[!] The following 3DNow! instructions still not implemented:
	PF2IW_PqQq
	PFNACC_PqQq
	PFPNACC_PqQq
	PFCMPGE_PqQq
	PFCMPGT_PqQq
	PFCMPEQ_PqQq
	PFMIN_PqQq
	PFMAX_PqQq
	PFRCP_PqQq
	PFRSQRT_PqQq
	PFSUB_PqQq
	PFSUBR_PqQq
	PFADD_PqQq
	PFACC_PqQq,
	PFMUL_PqQq
	PFRCPIT1_PqQq
	PFRSQIT1_PqQq
	PFRCPIT2_PqQq

[!] CPUID does not report 3DNow! instruction set

[!] Some of APIC functionality still not implemented, for example

    - Globally disabled APIC
    - NMI, SMI, INIT signals, LVT pins handling 
    - Filter interrupts according processor priority (PPR)

[!] No support of AC flag (alignment checking) and #AC exception

    #AC exception should be generated if trying to do unaligned memory 
    access when 
	CPL == 3 && CR.AM == 1 && EFLAGS.AC == 1

[!] REP NOP is PAUSE (on P4/XEON)

    When running in SMP mode, this means that we are in a spin loop.
    This processor should yield to the other one, as we are anyhow waiting
    for a lock, and any other processor is responsible for this.
