adore-ng works on kernel 2.6!

2.6.{3,4,6,8,10,11,16} UP and SMP tested! i386 and x86_64 architecture.

You need the module-init-tools for the new insmod, rmmod etc,
the old ones don't work anymore.

***************************************************************************
* To build a adore for 2.6, use the "Makefile.2.6" Makefile
* after you customized the elite UID etc. (or you did not,
* I dont care at all).
* Copy it to 'Makefile' and type 'make'.
***************************************************************************

The 2.6.0-test1 kernel has a different declaration for
the unix_dgram_recvmg() function than the 2.6.x kernel. Thats
why you may get some warning on 2.6.0 builds. You can ignore them.

With the 2.6 kernel, a version magic is build into the kernel
module (which are now .ko files carrying more info than
the old .o files for 2.4) which is even checked at loading time.
So, if the kernel is build with a different compiler than the
one used for building the module, you get an error like:

adore: version magic '2.6.3 586 gcc-3.2' should be '2.6.3 586 gcc-3.3'

To circumvent this you can set an own version magic in the
adore-ng.mod.c file (makes sense to use '2.6.3 586 gcc-3.3'
in this case) if you use the generic Makefile.
Or you set the -DCROSS_BUILD switch in the Makefile and
modify the version magic string in adore-ng-2.6.c.

LKM relinking ala Phrack61 is now also available for 2.6 kernels.
Use 'relink26' script for this.

2.6 kernels introduce a lot of changes during its lifetime.
One of them is that newer GCC and therefore newer kernels enforce
'const' on pointers. This means certain structures such as
UNIX datagram ops are placed on read-only locations. This
makes it impossible to hijack the syslog functions without
crashing. Therefore adore-ng walkes the page tables and
changes the UNIX dgram ops to read/write if it detects
a >= 2.6.16 kernel. This condition might not be true
in all cases. Maybe a newer GCC is installed with older kernels
such as 2.6.10. For this reason you can add a -DMODIFY_PAGE_TABLE
flag if you expect this. For systems such as x86-64 you also need to
enable -DFOUR_LEVEL_PAGING since it uses different paging
than x86. If you know a reliable way to automatically determine the
levels of paging, mail me.

Additionally the MODULE_PARM has been substituted by a module_param().
